It appears the API call to API-Football failed with a 403 Forbidden error, which typically indicates an authentication issue.

The `backend/services/apiFootballService.js` file relies on an environment variable named `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` (i.e., `process.env.API_FOOTBALL_KEY`). However, this key does not seem to be correctly loaded or set.

To resolve this, please follow these steps:

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** In your `backend/` directory, create a new file named `.env` (if you don't have one already). This file should not be committed to version control.
2.  **Add your API Key:** Open the newly created (or existing) `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `your_actual_api_football_key_here` with your valid API key from API-Sports:
    ```
    API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_actual_api_football_key_here
    ```
3.  **Ensure Key Validity:** Double-check that the API key you're using is active and has the necessary permissions on the API-Sports website.

After configuring your `.env` file, try running the test again. I cannot handle or ask for your API key for security reasons.
