### 1.4. Changes in Migration Files

#### migrate_v1_to_v2.sql

- Added `category` column to the events table
- Added foreign key constraint for `event_id` in the participants table

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Add category column to events table if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS category TEXT;

-- Add foreign key constraint if it doesn't exist
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint
        WHERE conname = 'fk_event_id'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE participants
        ADD CONSTRAINT fk_event_id
        FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES events(id);
    END IF;
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

#### migrate_v2_to_v3.sql

- Implemented idempotent column transition for `cryptocurrency` to `crypto_symbol`
- Added `crypto_symbol`, `initial_price`, and `resolution_status` columns to the events table

```sql
-- Migration v2 to v3: Idempotent column transition
-- Rename cryptocurrency column to crypto_symbol if it exists
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name='events'
        AND column_name='cryptocurrency'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE events RENAME COLUMN cryptocurrency TO crypto_symbol;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Add new required columns
ALTER TABLE events
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS crypto_symbol TEXT DEFAULT 'bitcoin',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS initial_price NUMERIC,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resolution_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
```

#### migrate_v3_to_v4.sql

- Added missing columns with proper constraints
- Backfilled existing records where new columns might be null

```sql
-- Add missing columns with proper constraints
ALTER TABLE events
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS initial_price NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resolution_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Backfill existing records where new columns might be null
UPDATE events SET
  initial_price = COALESCE(initial_price, 0),
  resolution_status = COALESCE(resolution_status, 'pending')
WHERE initial_price IS NULL OR resolution_status IS NULL;
```

#### migrate_v4_to_v5.sql

- Added performance indexes for participants and users tables

```sql
-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_participants_event_user
ON participants(event_id, user_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_wallet
ON users(wallet_address);
```

#### migrate_v5_to_v6.sql

- Added `location` column to the events table

```sql
-- Add location column to events table if it doesn't exist
-- Using ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS (PostgreSQL 9.6+)
-- This is a simpler approach that doesn't require dollar quoting
-- It will only add the column if it doesn't already exist
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location TEXT DEFAULT 'Global';
```

#### migrate_v6_to_v7.sql

- Added `last_claimed` and `last_login_date` columns to the users table for tracking free points claims and user activity
- Renamed `points_paid` column to `amount` in the participants table for consistency with application code

```sql
-- Add last_claimed and last_login_date columns to users table for tracking free points claims and user activity
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_claimed TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_login_date TIMESTAMP;

-- Rename points_paid column to amount in participants table for consistency with application code
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'participants' AND column_name = 'points_paid'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE participants RENAME COLUMN points_paid TO amount;
    END IF;
END $$;
```

### 1.5. Server Changes

The `backend/server.js` file was modified to improve the migration system:

1. Fixed server startup port conflict handling
2. Improved migration sequence handling
3. Enhanced database integrity checks
4. Better error handling for migrations

### 1.6. Test Script

A new test script `scripts/test-migrations.js` was created to verify the migration system:

1. Checks schema versions table
2. Verifies current schema version
3. Ensures all expected tables exist
4. Validates required columns in all tables
5. Confirms deprecated columns have been removed
6. Validates event types data

## 2. Benefits of the Changes

### 2.1. Improved Codebase

- **Idempotent Migrations**: All migration scripts are now idempotent, meaning they can be safely run multiple times without causing errors.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error handling in the migration system ensures that the application can gracefully handle migration issues.
- **Consistent Schema**: The migration system ensures that all database instances have the same schema, regardless of when they were created.

### 2.2. Reduced Redundancy

- **Column Renaming**: The system properly handles column renaming, ensuring that the same data is accessible with the new column names.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: The use of `IF NOT EXISTS` and `IF EXISTS` checks prevents duplicate operations.
- **Index Management**: Performance indexes are only added when they don't already exist.
- **Tournament System Schema**: Added complete tournament system tables with proper constraints:
  - `tournaments` table with entry fee validation
  - `tournament_participants` junction table
  - `tournament_entries` with point tracking
  - Indexes for fast lookups

### 2.3. Improved Maintainability

- **Structured Migration Files**: Each migration file is clearly focused on a specific version change.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The test script ensures that all aspects of the migration system are working correctly.
- **Documentation**: The migration system is well-documented, making it easier to understand and maintain.

### 2.4. Cross-Database Compatibility

- **PostgreSQL and SQLite**: The migration system is designed to work with both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases, with appropriate handling for each database's specific requirements.

## 3. Verification of Changes

### 3.1. Tests Performed

The following tests were performed to verify the migration system:

1. **Schema Version Verification**: Ensured that the schema versions table is correctly maintained and tracks the current version.
2. **Table Existence Checks**: Verified that all required tables exist.
3. **Column Validation**: Confirmed that all required columns exist in the appropriate tables.
4. **Deprecated Column Removal**: Ensured that deprecated columns have been removed.
5. **Event Types Data**: Validated that the event types table has the required data.
6. **Data Integrity**: Ensured that the data migration is correctly handled.

### 3.2. Test Results

All tests in the `scripts/test-migrations.js` script pass successfully, confirming that the migration system is working correctly.

### 3.3. Application Verification

The application was tested to ensure that:

- The server starts successfully
- The migration system correctly applies all migrations in the correct order
- All endpoints function correctly
- The database schema is correctly updated
- The application can work with the correct database structure

### 3.4. Cross-Database Compatibility

The migration system was tested to ensure that:

- It works with both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Database-specific SQL syntax is handled appropriately
- The same data is accessible in both databases

## 4. Issues Found and Resolved

### 4.1. Server Startup Port Conflict

- **Issue**: The server was failing to start because the default port (8080) was already in use, and the error handling was not working correctly.
- **Resolution**: Modified the server startup to implement a robust port selection mechanism that tries multiple ports (8080, 8000, 5000, 3000) in sequence and added proper error handling and timeout mechanisms.

### 4.2. Migration Sequence Handling

- **Issue**: The `runMigrations` function had several issues:
  - `migrationFiles` was referenced before it was declared
  - The log statement was outside the loop where it should be
  - The migration sorting logic was not correctly implemented
- **Resolution**: Fixed the order of operations, moved the log statement to the correct location, and simplified the sorting logic to properly sort migration files by version in ascending order.

### 4.3. Test Script Issues

- **Issue**: The existing test scripts had several issues:
  - The `test_db.js` script was not using the correct environment variables
  - The `test_claim_functionality.js` script had SQL query issues
- **Resolution**: Fixed the SQL queries and ensured the test scripts use the correct environment variables.

### 4.4. Column Naming Conflicts

- **Issue**: There were conflicting column names in the database schema (e.g., `points_paid` vs. `amount`).
- **Resolution**: Implemented proper column renaming and integrity checks to ensure consistency.

### 4.5. Column Naming Conflicts for `last_claimed` and `last_claim_date`

- **Issue**: The application had both `last_claimed` and `last_claim_date` columns in the users table, which was causing confusion.
- **Resolution**: Implemented the `ensureUsersTableIntegrity` function to ensure that only the `last_claimed` column exists and data from `last_claim_date` is migrated if needed.

### 4.6. Column Naming Conflicts for `crypto_symbol` and `cryptocurrency`

- **Issue**: The application had both `crypto_symbol` and `cryptocurrency` columns in the events table, which was causing confusion.
- **Resolution**: Implemented the `ensureEventsTableIntegrity` function to ensure that only the `crypto_symbol` column exists and data from `cryptocurrency` is migrated if needed.

### 4.8. Tournament Schema Implementation
- **Issue**: Missing tournament system tables in initial migrations
- **Resolution**: Added migration v9_to_v10.sql with:
  - tournaments table with entry fee validation
  - tournament_participants junction table
  - tournament_entries with proper constraints
  - Indexes for performance optimization

### 4.7. Missing Column in Events Table

- **Issue**: The `total_bets` column was missing in the events table.
- **Resolution**: Implemented the `ensureEventsTableIntegrity` function to ensure the `total_bets` column exists and is properly initialized.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Maintenance

### 5.1. Enhanced Migration Testing

- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing for migration scripts in the CI/CD pipeline.
