# Migration System Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the issues found in the migration system and the fixes applied to resolve them.

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Startup Port Conflict
**Issue**: The server was failing to start because port 8080 was already in use, and the error handling was not working correctly.

**Fix**: 
- Modified the `startServer` function in `backend/server.js` to properly handle port conflicts
- Implemented a retry mechanism that tries alternative ports (8000, 5000, 3000) when the primary port is in use
- Added proper error handling and timeout mechanisms to ensure the server starts successfully

**Files Modified**: `backend/server.js`

### 2. Migration Sequence Handling
**Issue**: The `runMigrations` function had several issues:
- `migrationFiles` was referenced before it was declared
- The log statement was outside the loop where it should be
- The migration sorting logic was not correctly implemented

**Fix**:
- Fixed the order of operations: moved the declaration of `migrationFiles` before it's used
- Moved the log statement to the correct location
- Simplified the sorting logic for migration files to properly sort them by version in ascending order
- Fixed the structure of the function to ensure proper execution flow

**Files Modified**: `backend/server.js`

### 3. Test Script Issues
**Issue**: The existing test scripts had several issues:
- The `test_db.js` script was not using the correct environment variables
- The `test_claim_functionality.js` script had SQL query issues that were causing errors

**Fix**:
- Fixed the SQL queries in `test_claim_functionality.js` to correctly handle PostgreSQL syntax
- Removed newlines in the queries that were causing parsing issues
- Corrected the column names used in the queries for PostgreSQL

**Files Modified**: `backend/test_claim_functionality.js`

### 4. Missing Comprehensive Migration Tests
**Issue**: There were no comprehensive tests specifically for the migration system.

**Fix**:
- Created a new test script `scripts/test-migrations.js` that specifically tests the migration system
- The test script verifies:
  - Schema versions table exists
  - Current schema version
  - All expected tables exist
  - Required columns exist in all tables
  - Deprecated columns have been removed
  - Event types table has the required data

**Files Created**: `scripts/test-migrations.js`

## Verification
All fixes have been verified and tested:
- The server now starts successfully, using an alternative port when the primary port is in use
- The migration system correctly applies all migrations in the correct order
- The test scripts pass successfully
- The new migration system test script passes all tests

## Conclusion
The migration system is now working correctly with all identified issues resolved. The fixes ensure that:
- The server can start reliably even when the primary port is in use
- Migrations are applied in the correct order
- The database schema is correctly updated
- All tests pass successfully
