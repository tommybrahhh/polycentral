# Frontend Changes Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to the frontend to ensure proper display of entry fees and prize pools.

## Changes Made

### 1. Event Creation Form Updates
- Changed the default entry fee in the event creation form from 250 to 0
- Updated the event creation logic to use the configured entry fee or default to 0
- Made the entry fee configurable in the event creation form

### 2. Display Updates
- Ensured that entry fees are properly displayed in event cards
- Ensured that prize pools are properly displayed in event cards
- Added proper formatting for currency values using `toLocaleString()`

### 3. User Balance Validation
- Updated the user balance validation to use the actual event entry fee instead of hardcoded 250
- Added proper error messaging when users have insufficient points

## Files Modified

### `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Updated default entry fee from 250 to 0 in the newEvent state initialization
- Updated event creation logic to use configured entry fee or default to 0
- Ensured proper display of entry fees and prize pools in event cards
- Added proper formatting for currency values

## Code Changes

### Event Creation Form Default Value
```javascript
// Before
const [newEvent, setNewEvent] = React.useState({
  // ... other fields
  entry_fee: 250
});

// After
const [newEvent, setNewEvent] = React.useState({
  // ... other fields
  entry_fee: 0
});
```

### Event Creation Logic
```javascript
// Before
entry_fee: parseInt(newEvent.entry_fee) || 250, // Use configured entry fee or default to 250

// After
entry_fee: parseInt(newEvent.entry_fee) || 0, // Use configured entry fee or default to 0
```

### Display Updates
```javascript
// Entry fee display
<span className="icon">ðŸŽ«</span>
Min. Entry: {event.entry_fee} points

// Prize pool display
<span className="icon">ðŸ’°</span>
Pot: ${event.prize_pool?.toLocaleString() || 0}
```

1. Create a new event with a custom entry fee
2. Verify that the entry fee is displayed correctly in the event card
3. Verify that the prize pool is displayed correctly in the event card
4. Attempt to place a bet with insufficient points to verify error messaging
5. Place a bet with sufficient points to verify the process works correctly
