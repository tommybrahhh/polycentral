## Overview of Changes

The recent frontend updates include two major improvements:

1. **Event Filtering**: Implementation of a helper function to filter out expired or finished events, ensuring only active events are displayed to users.
2. **Enhanced Countdown UI**: Creation of a new `CountdownTimer` component with real-time updates and visual enhancements including color coding based on time remaining.

These changes improve the user experience by providing a cleaner interface that only shows relevant events and offers more visually appealing, informative countdown timers.

## Event Filtering Implementation

### Helper Function: `isEventActive`

A new helper function `isEventActive` was implemented to determine whether an event is still active and should be displayed to users.

**Location**: `frontend/src/App.jsx` (lines 260-267)

**Functionality**:
- Checks if the current time is before the event's end time
- Ensures the event's status is not marked as 'expired'
- Returns a boolean value indicating whether the event is active

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const isEventActive = (event) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const endTime = new Date(event.end_time);
  const isActive = now < endTime && event.status !== 'expired';
  return isActive;
};
```

### Integration with Event Components

The `isEventActive` function is used in both the `EventsInterface` and `PredictionsInterface` components to filter events before rendering.

**EventsInterface**:
```javascript
{events.filter(isEventActive).map(event => (
  // Render event card
))}
```

**PredictionsInterface**:
```javascript
{events.filter(isEventActive).map(event => (
  // Render event card
))}
```

This implementation ensures that only active events are displayed to users, improving the relevance of the information presented.

## Countdown Timer Component

### Component Overview

A new `CountdownTimer` component was created to provide a more attractive and informative countdown display for events.

**Location**: `frontend/src/App.jsx` (lines 269-343)

### Features

1. **Real-time Updates**: The component updates every second to show the accurate time remaining.
2. **Dynamic Time Display**: Automatically formats the time display based on the remaining duration (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
3. **Color Coding**: Changes appearance based on the time remaining to indicate urgency.
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Properly cleans up the interval timer when the component unmounts.

### Implementation Details

**State Management**:
- `timeLeft`: Stores the calculated time remaining
- `isCritical`: Boolean flag for when time is less than 1 minute
- `isWarning`: Boolean flag for when time is less than 1 hour

**Effect Hook**:
- Uses `useEffect` to set up an interval timer that updates every second
- Calculates the time remaining between the current time and the event end time
- Determines warning states based on the remaining time
- Cleans up the interval when the component unmounts

**Time Display Formatting**:
- Shows days, hours, minutes, and seconds when appropriate
- Automatically adjusts the display format based on the remaining time
- Uses padding to ensure consistent two-digit display for time units

**Rendering**:
```javascript
const timerClass = `countdown-timer ${isCritical ? 'critical' : isWarning ? 'warning' : 'normal'}`;

return (
  <div className={timerClass}>
    <span className="icon">‚è∞</span>
    <span className="time-display">{getTimeDisplay()}</span>
  </div>
);
```

## Color Coding System

The countdown timer implements a color coding system to visually indicate the urgency of the event based on time remaining.

### Color States

1. **Normal State**:
   - Applied when time remaining is more than 1 hour
   - Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
   - Color: `var(--aero-text-primary)`
   - Border: `1px solid var(--aero-card-border)`
   - Animation: `pulse 2s infinite`

2. **Warning State**:
   - Applied when time remaining is less than 1 hour but more than 1 minute
   - Background: `rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.2)`
   - Color: `var(--color-warning)`
   - Border: `1px solid var(--color-warning)`
   - Animation: `pulse 1s infinite`
   - Box-shadow: `0 0 10px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3)`

3. **Critical State**:
   - Applied when time remaining is 1 minute or less
   - Background: `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2)`
   - Color: `var(--color-error)`
   - Border: `1px solid var(--color-error)`
   - Animation: `pulse 0.5s infinite`
   - Box-shadow: `0 0 15px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.4)`

### Animation Effects

The component uses a `pulse` animation to draw attention to the countdown timer, with the animation speed increasing as the event approaches its end time.

## CSS Changes

### New Styles for Countdown Timer

**Location**: `frontend/src/index.css` (lines 373-412)

**Added Styles**:
```css
/* Countdown Timer Styles */
.countdown-timer {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--spacing-xs);
  font-size: var(--body-text-size);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);
  padding: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-md);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius-md);
  transition: all var(--transition-normal);
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

.countdown-timer.normal {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  color: var(--aero-text-primary);
  border: 1px solid var(--aero-card-border);
}

.countdown-timer.warning {
  background: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.2);
  color: var(--color-warning);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-warning);
  animation: pulse 1s infinite;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);
}

.countdown-timer.critical {
  background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2);
  color: var(--color-error);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-error);
  animation: pulse 0.5s infinite;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.4);
}

.countdown-timer .time-display {
  font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}
```

### Additional CSS Changes

The existing card hover effect was also enhanced to better complement the new countdown timer:
```css
.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: var(--aero-card-shadow), 0 0 30px rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.4);
}
```

## Configuration Changes

No configuration changes were required for the frontend implementation. The changes are self-contained within the existing React application structure.

## Testing the Changes

### Testing the Event Filtering

1. **Verify Active Events Display**:
   - Navigate to the Events or Predictions page
   - Confirm that only active events are displayed
   - Check that expired events are not shown

2. **Test Event Status**:
   - Create events with different end times
   - Verify that events with `status: 'expired'` are not displayed
   - Confirm that events with future end times are displayed

### Testing the Countdown Timer

1. **Normal State**:
   - Create an event with more than 1 hour remaining
   - Verify that the countdown timer appears in the normal state (white text)
   - Confirm that the pulse animation is slow (2s interval)

2. **Warning State**:
   - Create an event with less than 1 hour but more than 1 minute remaining
   - Verify that the countdown timer appears in the warning state (orange text)
   - Confirm that the pulse animation is faster (1s interval)
   - Check that the orange box shadow is visible

3. **Critical State**:
   - Create an event with 1 minute or less remaining
   - Verify that the countdown timer appears in the critical state (red text)
   - Confirm that the pulse animation is fastest (0.5s interval)
   - Check that the red box shadow is visible

4. **Time Display Formatting**:
   - Test events with different time remaining:
     - Days: Should show "Xd Xh Xm" format
     - Hours: Should show "Xh Xm Xs" format
     - Minutes: Should show "Xm Xs" format
     - Seconds: Should show "Xs" format

### Testing the Real-time Updates

1. **Timer Accuracy**:
   - Observe the countdown timer for 1 minute
   - Confirm that it updates every second
   - Verify that the time remaining decreases accurately

2. **Timer Cleanup**:
   - Navigate away from the Events/Predictions page
   - Confirm that no timer errors appear in the console

## Potential Issues and Recommendations

### Potential Issues

1. **Performance with Many Events**:
   - With a large number of events, multiple interval timers could impact performance
   - Recommendation: Consider implementing a single interval timer that updates all countdowns

2. **Timezone Handling**:
   - The current implementation uses the client's local time
   - Recommendation: Ensure the backend provides UTC times and the frontend converts appropriately

3. **Accessibility**:
   - The color changes may not be sufficient for users with color vision deficiencies
   - Recommendation: Add additional visual indicators beyond color (e.g., text labels or icons)

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Event Filtering**:
   - Consider adding additional filter options (e.g., by event type)
   - Implement a search functionality to help users find specific events

2. **Improve Countdown Timer**:
   - Add a tooltip with more precise time information
   - Consider adding sound alerts for critical states (with user controls)
   - Implement a "time's up" visual effect when the timer reaches zero

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add a refresh button for events to manually update the list
   - Consider implementing a "closing soon" badge for events with less than 1 hour remaining
   - Add sorting options for events (e.g., by time remaining, prize pool)

4. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for the `isEventActive` function
   - Add tests for the `CountdownTimer` component with different time states
   - Create end-to-end tests to verify the filtering behavior

## Conclusion

The frontend changes have successfully improved the user experience by filtering out irrelevant events and providing a more visually appealing and informative countdown timer. The implementation follows React best practices and integrates well with the existing application structure. The color coding system provides clear visual cues about the urgency of events, helping users make better decisions about when to participate.

These changes align with the overall goals of the Polycentral Predictions application to create an engaging and user-friendly cryptocurrency prediction platform.
