-- Migration v10 to v11: Add missing total_bets column to events table
-- This migration ensures the events table has the total_bets column

-- SQLite doesn't support DO blocks, so we'll use the application's ensureEventsTableIntegrity function
-- to handle this migration. The function will be called after migrations in the server.js initialization

-- For now, we'll just add a comment to indicate this
SELECT 'Migration handled by application ensureEventsTableIntegrity function' as migration_status;
