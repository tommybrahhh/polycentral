-- Migration v9 to v10: Fix events table column naming and data types for SQLite
-- This migration ensures the events table has the correct column structure
-- and data types for compatibility between PostgreSQL and SQLite

-- SQLite doesn't support DO blocks, so we'll use the application's ensureEventsTableIntegrity function
-- to handle this migration. The function will be called after migrations in the server.js initialization

-- For now, we'll just add a comment to indicate this
SELECT 'Migration handled by application ensureEventsTableIntegrity function' as migration_status;
