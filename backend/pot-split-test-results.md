## Analysis

The test confirms the issues identified in the pot split functionality:

1. **Database Constraint Violation**: The error "null value in column 'participant_id' of relation 'platform_fees' violates not-null constraint" indicates that the code is trying to insert a record into the `platform_fees` table without providing a valid `participant_id`.

2. **No Points Distribution**: The winners did not receive their share of the pot, as evidenced by their unchanged point balances.

3. **Missing Event Outcomes**: No records were created in the `event_outcomes` table to track the results of the event for each participant.

## Conclusion

The pot split functionality is not working correctly due to issues in the `resolvePendingEvents` function in `backend/server.js`. The specific issues identified match those documented in `pot-split-fixes.md`:

1. Undefined variable references
2. Incorrect database operations
3. Missing variable declarations
4. Improper transaction handling

These issues prevent the proper distribution of the pot to winners and the recording of event outcomes.
