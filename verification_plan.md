# Verification Plan for Event Creation Fix

## Objective
Verify that the implemented fixes have resolved the issue of no events being created in the last 24 hours and that the system is now properly creating daily events.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Manual Event Creation Test
- Use the admin endpoint to manually trigger event creation
- Verify that the event is successfully created in the database
- Check logs for any error messages during the process

### 2. Database Verification
- Query the database to confirm a new event was created
- Verify the event has the correct:
  - Title with current Bitcoin price
  - Start and end times (24-hour duration)
  - Status set to 'active'
  - Entry fee of 100 points
  - Correct price range options

### 3. CoinGecko API Verification
- Confirm that the CoinGecko API was called successfully
- Verify the returned price is reasonable (not null/undefined)
- Check that the price range options were calculated correctly

### 4. Cron Job Monitoring
- Monitor the system for the next scheduled cron job execution (midnight UTC)
- Verify that the daily event creation runs automatically
- Check logs for successful execution

### 5. Long-term Monitoring
- Check for 3 consecutive days that events are created properly
- Monitor for any errors or failures in the event creation process
- Verify that the events are also being resolved properly after 24 hours

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (within 1 hour)
- [ ] Manual event creation via admin endpoint works
- [ ] New event appears in database with correct data
- [ ] No errors in logs during manual creation
- [ ] CoinGecko API returns valid price data

### Short-term Success (within 24 hours)
- [ ] Daily cron job executes at midnight UTC
- [ ] New event is automatically created by cron job
- [ ] Event data is correct and complete
- [ ] No errors in logs during automatic creation

### Long-term Success (3+ days)
- [ ] Events created for 3 consecutive days
- [ ] All events have correct data and structure
- [ ] No failures in event creation process
- [ ] Events are properly resolved after 24 hours

## Rollback Plan

If the fix does not work or causes new issues:

1. Revert the changes to the server.js file
2. Restore the previous version of the coingecko.js library
3. Monitor the system to ensure it returns to its previous state
4. Re-investigate the issue with additional logging
