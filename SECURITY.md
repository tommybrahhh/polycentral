# Security Practices

## API Key Management
API keys are stored in environment variables and never committed to the codebase. The backend server accesses these keys via `process.env`. 

Example configuration in `.env`:
```
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Rate Limiting Strategy
We implement exponential backoff for rate limiting on the CoinGecko API to prevent being rate limited. The strategy includes:
- Initial delay: 1000ms
- Maximum retries: 5
- Backoff factor: 2

## Error Handling
- API errors are logged with timestamps and error details
- Failed requests are retried using the exponential backoff strategy
- Critical errors trigger application alerts

## Best Practices
1. **Input Validation**: All user input is validated to prevent injection attacks
2. **HTTPS**: Application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit
3. **Environment Segregation**: Different environment files for development and production
4. **Secret Rotation**: API keys are rotated periodically
5. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for database access
